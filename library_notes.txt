Description of available C shared libraries (DLL) for itcsim.

To compile, you should just be able to run "./configure" followed by "make"
If you've made changes or added a library, re-run autoconf by using "autoreconf -i"

Note that in addition to the delta G parameters, each model also has delta H (enthalpies) parameters for each configuration.

itc_sim_sk
	As described by Saroff and Kiefer (1997)
	Parameters:
	dG	delta G of binding
	a	scaling factor for coupling to an unoccupied site
	b	coupling to an occupied site

itc_sim_ian
	Statistical thermodynamics model described by Ian Kleckner in his thesis
	Parameters:
	dG	delta G of binding to a site with no bound neighbors
	a	scaling factor when site has one occupied neighbor
	b	scaling factor when site has two occupied neighbors


itc_sim_hybrid
	A combination of the SK model and Ian's, where a different scaling factor is used if both neighboring sites are occupied.
	Parameters:
	dG
	a	scaling factor for coupling to an unoccupied site
	b	scaling factor to only a single occupied site
	c	scaling factor when both neighboring sites are occupied
