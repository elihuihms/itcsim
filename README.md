## itcsimlib : A statistical thermodynamics isothermal titration calorimeter simulator

# Introduction

itcsimlib is python module that uses statistical thermodynamics models to simulate and fit binding data, in particular those obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Because statistical thermodynamics models can calculate the prevalence of individual lattice+ligand configurations, itcsimlib can be readily adapted to fit mass spectrometry data.

Note: itcsimlib doesn't possess a GUI. You will need to write scripts in Python that make use of itcsimlib classes, in a manner that users of [XPLOR-NIH](https://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/) and other programmatic analysis tools will find quite familiar. 

If you're not familiar with Python, the provided Jupyter notebooks and scripts in the tutorial and examples directories should give you off to a good start. Although itcsimlib comes with several binding models that may fit your data, to really leverage itcsimlib you'll want to write your own models. You may want to try [itcsimlib-blockly](https://github.com/elihuihms/itcsimlib-blockly), which uses Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) visual programming language to build statistical thermodynamics models that work with itcsimlib.

If at any point you need help, have constructive criticism, or wish to contribute some of your own ideas or models to itcsimlib, please contact the author at mail@elihuihms.com.

# Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for all required dependencies. Note that Tkinter is necessary only if you want to use the Manipulator class to visualize the effects of changing model parameters in realtime. Ultimately, the easiest and quickest route to get started is probably to install the Anaconda Python stack available at https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

# Installing itcsimlib

```
cd itcsimlib
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

If you want to compile the optional TRAP + Tryptophan models that are written in C, you'll either want to run the setup script with the `--build-c-models` flag, or use the traditional configure/make scripts (see `src/model_trap`). Keep in mind that these models require the GNU scientific library: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.
