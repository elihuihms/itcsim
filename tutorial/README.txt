# The itcsimlib Tutorials
#

Note that each of the tutorial chapters are valid itcsimlib scripts. To progress through the tutorial, open each chapter in a text editor, such as TextWrangler on the Macintosh, Notepad++ on Windows, or Gedit/EMACs on Linux. Read through each line to understand how to correctly invoke itcsimlib routines. Before making any changes, I would recommend executing each chapter and understanding the expected output.

Once you've read each chapter, invoke it in your terminal's command-line. This can be your Terminal.app on the Mac, or CMD.exe in Windows. Linux users will already know all about command line interfaces. You can call python explicitly and provide the chapter script as the first argument. e.g:

$>python chapter_1.py

#
# Each chapter of the tutorial covers a different topic or aspect of itcsimlib's usage:
#

Chapter 1 covers the general format of an itcsimlib analysis script, and introduces simulation and model objects.

Chapter 2 covers reading experimental data files, fitting models, and getting fit parameter confidence intervals.

Chapter 3 covers evaluating model parameters over a discrete range via grids.

Chapter 4 covers the development of new models.

Chapter 5 covers the use of the manipulator object, which permits real-time visualization of model parameter effects.
