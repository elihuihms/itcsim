# The itcsimlib Tutorials
#

If you haven't read the itcsimlib README.txt and understood the terms of use in LICENSE.txt, please do that first.

Note that each of the tutorial chapters are actually valid itcsimlib scripts, but need their extension changed in order to be interpreted by Python. To progress through the tutorial, first open each chapter in a text editor, such as TextWrangler on the Macintosh, Notepad++ on Windows, or Gedit/EMACs on Linux-based workstations. Read through each line to understand how to correctly invoke itcsimlib routines, and then save the file with a ".py" extension"

Once you've saved each chapter as a Python script, invoke it in your terminal's command-line. This can be your Terminal.app on the Mac, or CMD.exe in Windows. Most Linux geeks will already know all about command line interfaces. You can call python explicitly and provide the chapter script as the first argument. e.g:
$>python chapter_1.py

#
# Each chapter of the tutorial covers a different topic or aspect of itcsimlib's usage:
#

Chapter 1 covers the general format of an itcsimlib analysis script, and introduces simulation and model objects.

Chapter 2 covers reading experimental data files, fitting models, and getting fit parameter confidence intervals.

Chapter 3 covers evaluating model parameters over a discrete range via grids.

Chapter 4 covers the development of new models.

Chapter 5 covers the use of the manipulator object, which permits real-time visualization of model parameter effects.
